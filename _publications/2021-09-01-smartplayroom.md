excerpt: 'We tested 4-9.5-year-old children on a naturalistic memory-guided attention visual search task. We measured fixation distribution during a search using wearable eye tracking, and simultaneously recorded depth video data for each participant and used computer vision algorithms to track them during navigation. We manipulated object placement and trial order such that nearby objects would be encountered during initial search for reference objects. We used a computational model of top-down guidance for reference object visual features and examined the use of this top-down attention for reference objects during subsequent nearby object search. The data suggest that the value of physical navigation during initial spatial exploration for subsequent memory-guided attention, specifically in early childhood, is in its association with stronger visual representations of goal reference objects during spatial exploration. By middle childhood, visual search times were not impacted by memory engagement.'
