title: "Cosmicflows-4: The Catalog of ∼10,000 Tully–Fisher Distances"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2020-10-cosmicflows
excerpt: 'We present the distances of 9792 spiral galaxies lying within 15,000 km s−1 using the relation between luminosity and rotation rate of spiral galaxies. The sample is dominantly, but not exclusively, drawn from galaxies detected in the course of the ALFALFA H i survey with the Arecibo Telescope. Relations between H i line widths and luminosity are calibrated at SDSS u, g, r, i, z bands and WISE W1 and W2 bands. By exploiting secondary parameters, particularly color indices, we address discrepancies between measured distances at different wave bands with unprecedented detail. We provide a catalog that includes reduced kinematic, photometric, and inclination parameters. We also describe a machine-learning algorithm, based on the random forest technique, that predicts the dust attenuation in spirals lacking infrared photometry. We determine a Hubble Constant value of H0 = 75.1 ± 0.2(stat.), with potential systematics up to ±3 km s−1 Mpc−1.'

We present the distances of 9792 spiral galaxies lying within 15,000 km s−1 using the relation between luminosity and rotation rate of spiral galaxies. The sample is dominantly, but not exclusively, drawn from galaxies detected in the course of the ALFALFA H i survey with the Arecibo Telescope. Relations between H i line widths and luminosity are calibrated at SDSS u, g, r, i, z bands and WISE W1 and W2 bands. By exploiting secondary parameters, particularly color indices, we address discrepancies between measured distances at different wave bands with unprecedented detail. We provide a catalog that includes reduced kinematic, photometric, and inclination parameters. We also describe a machine-learning algorithm, based on the random forest technique, that predicts the dust attenuation in spirals lacking infrared photometry. We determine a Hubble Constant value of H0 = 75.1 ± 0.2(stat.), with potential systematics up to ±3 km s−1 Mpc−1.
