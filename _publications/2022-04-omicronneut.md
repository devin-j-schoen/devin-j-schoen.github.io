title: "Omicron neutralizing antibody response following booster vaccination compared with breakthrough infection"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2022-04-omicronneut
excerpt: 'The rapid spread of the vaccine-resistant Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 presents a renewed threat to both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals, and accelerated booster vaccination campaigns are underway to mitigate the ongoing wave of Omicron cases. The degree of immunity provided by standard vaccine regimens, boosted regimens, and immune responses elicited by the combination of vaccination and natural infection remain incompletely understood. The relative magnitude, quality and durability of serological responses, and the likelihood of neutralizing protection against future SARS-CoV-2 variants following these modes of exposure are unknown but are critical to the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study of 99 vaccinated adults, we find that compared with responses after two doses of an mRNA regimen, the immune responses three months after a third vaccine dose and one month after breakthrough infection due to prior variants show dramatic increases in magnitude, potency, and breadth, including increased antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis and robust neutralization of the recently circulating Omicron variant. These results suggest that as the number of Omicron cases rise and as global vaccination and booster campaigns continue, an increasing proportion of the world’s population will acquire potent immune responses that may be protective against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.'

The rapid spread of the vaccine-resistant Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 presents a renewed threat to both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals, and accelerated booster vaccination campaigns are underway to mitigate the ongoing wave of Omicron cases. The degree of immunity provided by standard vaccine regimens, boosted regimens, and immune responses elicited by the combination of vaccination and natural infection remain incompletely understood. The relative magnitude, quality and durability of serological responses, and the likelihood of neutralizing protection against future SARS-CoV-2 variants following these modes of exposure are unknown but are critical to the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study of 99 vaccinated adults, we find that compared with responses after two doses of an mRNA regimen, the immune responses three months after a third vaccine dose and one month after breakthrough infection due to prior variants show dramatic increases in magnitude, potency, and breadth, including increased antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis and robust neutralization of the recently circulating Omicron variant. These results suggest that as the number of Omicron cases rise and as global vaccination and booster campaigns continue, an increasing proportion of the world’s population will acquire potent immune responses that may be protective against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.
