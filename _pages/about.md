I am a Ph.D. student in the Bioengineering program at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. With a background in Physics, I decided to bridge the gap between Physics and Medicine by getting a M.S. in Medical Physics at Oregon Health & Science University, where I discovered my passion for Medical Imaging. My previous research has involved designing and building particle detectors and using PET imaging to study substance use disorders.
I am working with Dr. Melanie Morrison (https://morrisonlab.ucsf.edu/), investigating how brain stimulation can be most effectively used to improve patients' lives with Parkinson's disease. My research focuses on building and modeling multi-modal (anatomical MR, susceptibility mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, etc.) models to predict deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedure outcomes.

Beyond Research
======
In my free time, I am an avid reader (Science Fiction and Fantasy mainly) and enjoy games (board, card, video). When my brain needs a break from my normal research, I like to study languages and classical literature or practice crafts like crocheting and ceramics. 
I like to spend time outdoors, but I take it slow and leisurely.
