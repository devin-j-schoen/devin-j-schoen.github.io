I am a PhD student in Neuroscience program at the University of British Columbia, department of psychiatry. I am located at the djavad mowafaghian center for brain health within UBC Hospital.
At work, I develop computational tools and collaborate with coworkers to explore relation between brain and behavior with in vivo imaging. With a computer science background, I am relatively new to neuroscience and am excited to have made that transition. My research work involves neuronal calcium imaging, closed-loop neurofeedback using a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to investigate plasticity and learning.

Traveling and anything outdoors, mountains and water excite me. I love meeting new people and learning about them.
