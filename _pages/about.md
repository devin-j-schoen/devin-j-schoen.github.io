I am a Ph.D. student in the joint Bioengineering program through UC-Berkeley and UCSF. With a background in Physics, I decided to bridge the gap between Physics and Medicine by getting a Masters in Medical Physics where I discovered my passion for medical imaging. My previous research involved desiging and building particle detectors and using PET imaging to study substance use disorders.
I am currently working in the Radiology Department of UCSF, rotatiting with different investigators to find the best fit for my thesis research. I intend to continue in the field of imaging to improve understanding and treatment of Neuropathologies.

Beyond Research
======
In my free time I am an avid reader (Science Fiction and Fantasy mainly) and enjoy games (board, card, video) every once and awhile. When my brain needs a break from my normal studies, I like to study languages and classical literature or practice crafts like crocheting and ceramics. 
I like to spend time outdoors, but take it slow and leisurely.
