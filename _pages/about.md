Traveling and anything outdoors, mountains and water excites me. I love meeting new people and learning about them. At work, I develop computational tools and collaborate with coworkers to explore relation between brain and behavior with in vivo imaging. With a computer science background, I am relatively new to neuroscience and am excited to have made that transition.
