Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage neural activity to control external effectors â€“ from cursors on two-dimensional screens to artificial limbs with many degrees of freedom. Best known for their use in neuroprosthetics, BMIs provide a powerful tool for basic neurobiological research by enabling experimental control over otherwise inaccessible neural and behavioural parameters.
