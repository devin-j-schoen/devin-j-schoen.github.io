What classical neuroscience result would you revisit with a BMI? (Neural Interfaces for Neurobiological Insights)	Talk	nini	Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, 25 Howland Street, London, W1T 4JG	2020-10-09	London, UK	https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/events/annual-symposium-neural-interfaces-neurobiological-insights	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage neural activity to control external effectors â€“ from cursors on two-dimensional screens to artificial limbs with many degrees of freedom. Best known for their use in neuroprosthetics, BMIs provide a powerful tool for basic neurobiological research by enabling experimental control over otherwise inaccessible neural and behavioural parameters.
