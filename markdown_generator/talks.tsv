What classical neuroscience result would you revisit with a BMI? (Neural Interfaces for Neurobiological Insights)	Talk	nini	Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, 25 Howland Street, London, W1T 4JG	2020-10-09	London, UK	https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/events/annual-symposium-neural-interfaces-neurobiological-insights	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage neural activity to control external effectors – from cursors on two-dimensional screens to artificial limbs with many degrees of freedom. Best known for their use in neuroprosthetics, BMIs provide a powerful tool for basic neurobiological research by enabling experimental control over otherwise inaccessible neural and behavioural parameters.
Real-time Neural Feedback of Mesoscale Cortical GCaMP6 Signals Using Raspberry-Pi	Talk	ccnsv2	Online	2021-05-17	Online	https://www.crowdcast.io/e/ccnsv2/15	The Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS) was created following the mass cancellations and postponements of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new, entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee presentations.
